# wiki-scraper

I created this small scraping script so that I had a larger amount of data to display in my mango-api! While this only works for a specific wikipedia page it serves as a boilerplate for Puppeteer and can easily be built upon or adapted to your needs.


name, image, origin, and notes are gathered for each mango in the list and exported to a JSON file.
